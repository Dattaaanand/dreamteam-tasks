# Wireframes
---

Hello there, I completed the wireframes for the Mobile View and Desktop View of the website using `Figma`.

> Figma is a web-based design tool that allows users to collaborate on projects and create interactive prototypes

> Wireframes serve as the skeletons for designs, acting as blueprints for the design and development phases. They provide clarity and direction for the project, laying the groundwork upon which the designs are built.

Below are the links to access my Wireframes.
