# Dual Booting Linux
### I Already have prior experience in dual booting and installation of Linux.
- Currently using Parrot OS
- Configuration : Installed with GRUB bootloader, enabling selection between Parrot OS and the primary OS at startup.
- Why Parrot ? Parrot OS is used for cybersecurity tasks, penetration testing, and secure development practices, leveraging the OS’s wide range of pre-installed security tools.
#### Parrot OS is a Debian-based Linux distro built for cybersecurity, offering tools for ethical hacking, digital forensics, and privacy. Known for its lightweight design, it’s ideal for penetration testing, vulnerability analysis, and secure, anonymous browsing.
