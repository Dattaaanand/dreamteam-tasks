## Knowledge I gained from this Task:

### This task was a little time consuming as I had to learn and read many concepts about Open Source. It was a little challenging but in the end I got to learn about so many stuff.

<ul> 
    Google Dorking : Google Dorking is a powerful way to find information online. Doing this task made me learn more about how google dorking works even though it's just th basic idea.
        <ul> 
            Web Crawlers : Web Crawlers are also called spiders that browse particular websites on internet and locate the content which is present in a partuclar section in a website.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Google also has its web crawler known as `Googlebot`. You can see these names on your website logs.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            You can control which crawlers to give access  to and which crawlers to deny, and also control which content to be restricted from crawlers using a special file called **robots.txt**
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Indexing is the term used for the crawlers visiting different sites. Crawlerrs index through websites.
        </ul>
        <ul>
            All websites have sitemaps which are xml files.
            Sitemap cant be found at `http://mywebsite.com/sitemap.xml`
        </ul>
        <ul>
            Sitemaps are like geographical maps but for websites. Sitemaps are indicative resources that are helpful to the crawlers to find the specific route to reach a specific domain.
        </ul>
</ul>

#### About the Remaining prts of Task-02... I have published a blog in Medium.

The Blog contains Information about Open Source Licenses, How to contribute to an Open Source Project(Like Linux) - What License is being used and so on, Conventional Commits, and What are the Best GIT Practices.
